Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

The aim of this project is to detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

In order to try out this code, please run the 'Main.ipynb' file with the appropriate libraries set up in your machine.

Description
---
This project used methods such as Camera calibration, Warping an Image, Gradient operator, using HLS color spaces in order to find lanes on the road


##The Project
---
The 'output_images' directory contains the images that were output from the 'test_images'. This was done in order to calibrate the image processing parameters.
The final video output for the input video 'project_video.mp4' is 'my_video.mp4'
